There's something deeply satisfying about stripping away everything unnecessary until only the essential remains.

Minimalism isn't about deprivation or asceticism. It's about clarity. When you remove the noise, what matters becomes obvious. The signal emerges from the static.

In design, this means:

- No unnecessary decoration
- No visual gimmicks
- No features for the sake of features

What remains should serve a clear purpose. Every element should earn its place.

This blog embodies that philosophy. Text, whitespace, and nothing else. The content speaks for itself.
